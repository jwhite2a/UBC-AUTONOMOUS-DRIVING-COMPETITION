 Built a Convolutional Neural Network with three different networks to identify and read the license plates on the cars.
 Heavily augmented the training data and did error analysis using confusion matrix to get robust results.
  The robot was able to read all the license plates correctly at the competition.
 Used classical Computer Vision techniques (OpenCV) to navigate the robot, the algorithm successfully stayed on the road,
  detected the cross walk and avoided collision with the pedestrians.
